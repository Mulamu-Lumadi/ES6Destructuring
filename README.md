# ES6Destructuring

Destructing objects using arrays and objects. When multiple objects exist in an array, each constant in the destructuring variables (can have a name of any choosing) represents an object, with each object skipped represented by an openspace and a comma. Individual object properties are destructed by using their names (though renaming properties is possible).
